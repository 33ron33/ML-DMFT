# ML-DMFT: A Hybrid Approach for Hubbard Model

## Abstract: 
Understanding strongly correlated electron systems in condensed matter is fundamental for unraveling complex phenomena observed in high-temperature superconductors, magnetic materials, and Mott insulators. The Hubbard Model, renowned for encapsulating the essence of interacting electrons in a lattice, poses significant challenges when addressing the entire lattice simultaneously. This study employs Iterated Perturbation Theory (IPT) within the Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (DMFT) framework to explore the Hubbard model for spin 1/2 systems. The primary aim is to simulate the transition from metallic to insulating states at half-filling, where the Mott transition is expected. IPT offers a computationally efficient approach for obtaining precise solutions, enabling the calculation of the local Green's function and self-energy and facilitating an investigation into the density of states and spectral functions. Additionally, this project integrates machine learning techniques to predict and analyze these properties, enhancing our capability to model and understand the critical transitions and electron correlations in strongly correlated systems. This dual approach not only elucidates the role of electron correlations in Mott transitions but also showcases the potential of combining traditional physical models with advanced computational methods to gain deeper insights into complex electronic systems.
